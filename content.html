  <h1>Oh hey there, baby ally :)ðŸŒ¸</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph -->
  <p>Someone once said, "If I had a flower for every time I've thought of you, we could spend forever walking in my garden."
    And if I had a star for every time you've made me smile, I would carry up infinite constellations.</p>
  <p>Alison Kate, I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over and over and over again.
    Without pause, without a doubt in my mind, in a single heartbeat, in just one breath, without a second to spare, I'd still choose YOU.</p>
  <p>I see you, I feel you, and I love you (THE MOST SHUT UP I WON!)      
    <br/>
    "If you could see you the way I see you, you'd see that you're worth every sacrifice I'd ever make".</p>
